Questions: 
1. modulated genes between cluster
=> Subcluster analysis : differential gene expression 

2. which cells express a known gene
=> see 2D plot and UmiCountPerGenes

3. new markers for cluster of cell?
=> Table under Co-expression -  selected, change parameters for min "min UMI count per gene:" and "min percentage of cells expressing a genes:"

4. coexpressed genes within a cluster?
=> see 3. and 1.

5. plot cell populations based on different markers
=> see 2. 

6. minimal signature of a cluster?
=> outside of schnapps using mutal information
or using schnapps DGE - highly expressed genes - violing plot or 2D plot using UmiCountPerGenes with those genes, color by group.

7. pathway analysis how to do?
=> Download DGE table and use somewhere else e.g. http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/compute_overlaps.jsp

8. identify potential doublets
=> visually inspect before.filter count vs. Gene.count in 2D visualization


9. identify potentially stressed cells.
=> see 8.


10. input to schnapps
-> see prepIllumina.Rmd

11. how to create groups of cells
-> 2D plot, more options, select cells, click on "change current selection"
--> the cells used for this are set by what is selcted in the dropdown called "group names"
---> Here, "plot" means, take selection from plot
--> cells can be added to a group by selection the appropiate check-box

12. how to calculate the correlation coefficient when UmiCountPerGenes and UmiCountPerGenes2 are selected?
=> not implemented yet, I will put it on the to-do list.
